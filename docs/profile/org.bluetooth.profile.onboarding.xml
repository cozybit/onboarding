		<Abstract>
			The Onboarding profile enables one device to configure
			another device in order to connect to a WiFi network.  
		</Abstract>
		<Summary>
			The Onboarding profile defines how one device that is
			connected to a wireless network (the onboarder) can use
			Bluetooth to bring another device (onboardee) onto that
			same wireless network.  

			The profile supports transferring the wireless
			configuration parameters from the onboarder onto the
			onboardee as well as having the onboardee report
			connection status in real-time via asynchronous alerts.
